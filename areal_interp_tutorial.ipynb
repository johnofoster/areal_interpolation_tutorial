    "# Areal Interpolation in Python using Tobler - A Jupyter Notebook Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Areal interpolation is the process where the attributes of one set of polygons are interpolated to a different set of polygons. There are many applications for this process, for example, the interpolation of census data from census tracts to neighborhoods, or the interpolation of aggregated environment data from one set of geographic boundaries to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tobler, a component of the [Python Spatial Analysis Library](https://pysal.org/) (PySAL) is a package of Python functions designed to perform and support areal interpolation. Visit Tobler's [website](https://pysal.org/tobler/index.html) and [github page](https://github.com/pysal/tobler) for the official documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Jupyter notebook tutorial we will use Tobler to perform two different methods of areal interpolation on two different scales of source data. In Part 1 we will use areal weighted and dasymetric methods to interpolate 2016 Canadian census data from Ottawa census tracts and dissemination areas to Ottawa neighborhoods. In part 2 we will do same but with synthetic population data instead of real data. By using this synthetic dataset we will know exactly what the results should be and thus more accurately assess the effect of the methods and scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "The intended audience of this tutorial are students who have some prior experience using Python, JupyterLab, Jupyter Notebooks, Pandas, and GeoPandas. That being said, the code should work as-is, providing all students with the opportunity to follow along through the steps of the analysis. If you are new to Jupyter notebooks and need help running code cells or performing other basic operations then check out [Project Jupyter's introductory tutorials](https://jupyter.org/try). I have included links to the different packages' documentation throughout the tutorial and feel free to insert or split cells at any point in order to inspect any intermediate data.\n",

    "#### Area Weighted Interpolation\n",
    "\n",
    "Area weighted interpolation works by intersecting the source and target geometries, calculating the areal weights (i.e. the proportion a source geometry is covered by each given target geometry), and then allocating a proportional amount of the variable from the source to the targets. Please refer to Tobler's documentation of the [`tobler.area_weighted.area_interpolate()`](https://pysal.org/tobler/generated/tobler.area_weighted.area_interpolate.html) function for a mathematical description and help with the parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing to consider is whether the variable to be interpolated is extensive or intensive. An extensive variable is one that depends on the size of the sample (e.g. population counts) while an intensive variable does not (e.g. population density). In this tutorial we will only be working with extensive variables (population counts) but it's worth noting that Tobler's interpolation methods can handle both types through the use of different parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned, the areal interpolation operation will be performed twice: first with the census tracts as the source data, then with the dissemination areas. This will allow us to compare the results of these different source geometries to see if there's any benefit gained by using smaller census geographies (i.e. dissemination areas) as the source.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the `tobler.area_weighted.area_interpolate()` function we will pass source and target GeoDataFrames to it along with the column name of the extensive variable. The extensive variable will then be interpolated from the source geometry to the target geometry. The result will be a GeoDataFrame containing the target geometries and interpolated values of the extensive variable. After running these cells there will be no output but the results will be saved to the `ct_area_interp_gdf` and `da_area_interp_gdf` variables. These will be plotted once all four interpolation operations have been completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that these three spatial dataset have already been reprojected into the WGS 84 / UTM 18N (EPSG:32618) CRS. If you use Tobler with your own GeoDataFrames it's recommended to explicitly reproject the data into an appropriate UTM zone beforehand, even though Tobler will try to do this automatically. Reprojecting a GeoDataFrame is easily accomplished with the [`gdf.to_crs()`](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/docs/reference/api/geopandas.GeoDataFrame.to_crs.html) method."

    "#### Dasymetric Interpolation of Census Tracts and Dissemination Areas\n",
    "\n",
    "Dasymetric interpolation, or masked area weighted interpolation, incorporates secondary information to help refine the spatial distribution of the variable. For example, the extent of census tracts may include large portions of land that are uninhabited (e.g. parks, fields, water, etc.). Secondary information about the census tracts' land cover is used to mask out those uninhabited areas which don't contain the extensive variable. Area weighted interpolation is then applied to the masked census tracts and the results should be more accurate than simple area weighted interpolation on its own. This can be done by clipping the census tracts' using another set of appropriate polygons(e.g. land cover polygons, municipal zoning, etc.) and then running the areal interpolation function, but Tobler includes a function to do this automatically using a land cover raster as the secondary information. Please refer to Tobler's documentation of the `tobler.dasymetric.masked_area_interpolate()`](https://pysal.org/tobler/generated/tobler.dasymetric.masked_area_interpolate.html#tobler.dasymetric.masked_area_interpolate) function for help with the parameters.\n",

This 30 m spatial resolution land cover product is produced every 5 years and covers the whole country. Tobler's dasymetric interpolation function will automatically clip the raster to the extent of the source data (City of Ottawa) but I have already clipped it to reduce the file-size and processing time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The path of the land cover raster and the pixel value(s) of the land cover classes that contain dwellings are passed to the function along with the source and target GeoDataFrames, and the column name of the extensive variable. The result is a GeoDataFrame made up of the target geometries with interpolated values for the extensive variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the same reason as before, we will perform the dasymetric interpolation twice: first with the census tracts as the source data, and then with the dissemination areas. `masked_area_interpolate()` will throw some warnings but just ignore them.

    "Because the Ottawa Neighbourhood Study data came with a population estimate for each neighborhood (`nbhd_pop_est`) we can compare those original estimated values against the interpolated values. That being said, it's important to note that the accuracy of this assessment will be very limited for a number of reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Metadata associated with the Ottawa neighborhood survey data does not specify the year of their population estimates. This data was first published to the Open Ottawa data portal on November 25, 2019 and then updated on June 2, 2021. The census tract and dissemination area population data comes from the 2016 census.\n",
    "2. Metadata associated with the Ottawa neighborhood survey data does not specify the methodology they used for estimating the neighborhood populations. Perhaps it comes from an areal interpolation method similar to what we are using or perhaps from a higher resolution data set that is not public (e.g. size of each households).\n",
    "3. The Ottawa neighborhood survey data indicates that the 'Beechwood Cemetery' and 'Notre-Dame Cemetery' neighborhoods have populations of 139 and 17, respectively, despite no evidence of residences within them.\n",
    "4. The sum of all the neighborhood population estimates is 867146 while the census_tracts' sum is 934243. These last two points suggest that these neighborhood population estimates are the result of interpolation from an unknown dataset (2011 census data perhaps?).\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite these issues we will go ahead and use these estimates to assess the interpolation results. We will do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Merge the interpolation results with the neighborhood population estimates so we can compare a sample of the results\n",
    "2. Perform a statistical assessment of the interpolation results\n",
    "3. Visually assess the percent error of each neighborhood (interpolated population vs `nbhd_pop_est`) as a map\n",
    "4. Create a 1:1 scatter plot of the interpolation results against the neighborhood population estimates\n",
    "5. Discuss the results\n"

    "From these statistics it's pretty clear that, when comparing the results from the same source data, the dasymetric method is more effective than the area weighted method. This is shown by the lower error values (as represented by the RMSE, NRMSE, and MAE) and higher correlations (r values) achieved by the dasymetric method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, these statistics also show that using the relatively small dissemination areas as the source data yields the lowest errors and highest correlations - regardless of the interpolation method. This makes sense, as the dissemination areas are much smaller than the census tracts, giving a higher spatial resolution of data for the re-aggregation of the extensive variable from the source to the target geometries. The 'masking' approach that the dasymetric method uses can be seen as an attempt to mimic a higher spatial resolution source dataset, in both cases improving the results compared to the simple area weighted method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Positive MBE values for all four interpolation results show that all four interpolation results are coming out higher than the neighborhood population estimates. As previously discussed, this is due to a higher total population in the census data (934243) than in the neighborhood data (867146). It's too bad these neighborhood estimates aren't closer to the census data as that would help to make this assessment more credible.\n",

Plotly offers a very powerful set of plotting tools which render spatial and non-spatial data as interactive figures.

Before creating the Plotly choropleth facet plots the data needs to be reworked into a specific format. The geometries have be supplied in the GeoJson format and the values have to be melted into a single column with an additional column providing labels.\n",

While it does support tiled base maps through their MapBox figures (e.g., `px.choropleth_mapbox()`) it's not possible to create facet plots (i.e., side-by-side plots) with a tiled base map. Also, Plotly doesn't make it easy to represent the values as discrete classified bins instead of a continuous color scale. Instead, in the map above I've simply limited the `Error (%)` color bar range to 100 despite some neighborhoods having higher percent errors higher than 100.

    "* Neighborhoods with small populations (e.g., Carleton University, Beechwood Cemetary, Notre-Dame Cemetary, Lebreton Development) show high percent errors, possibly due to having low populations while being surrounded by neighborhoods with high populations.\n",
    "* Neighborhoods with high populations, (e.g.,Stittsville, Centretown, Old Barrhaven East and \"Bridlewood - Emerald Meadows\") have interpolated populations that are consistently higher than the neighbourhood population estimates.

    "\n",
    "We first need to generate a dataset containing a synthetic population. Ideally, we would have access to a dataset where every person in Ottawa is identified as a point at their dwelling but, because StatCan doesn't release this fine scale for privacy reasons, we will have to approximate it.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we want to do is create a distribution of points that does a pretty good job of approximating the actual distribution of people within a city. It has to have a non-uniform density and be spatially limited to those areas where people actually live. Datasets that could help to approximate this include city land use zones, building footprints, and high resolution land cover maps. To keep things relatively simple here we will just do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Clip the dissemination areas to the urban land cover type\n",
    "   * Tobler provides a handy function that extracts specific land cover types from a raster and then outputs a GeoDataFrame containing their extent: [`tobler.dasymetric.extract_raster_features()`](https://pysal.org/tobler/generated/tobler.dasymetric.extract_raster_features.html)\n",
    "2. Clip the clipped dissemination areas to Ottawa's land use zones which permit dwellings\n",
    "   * These land use zones come from [Section 35 of the City of Ottawa's zoning definitions](https://ottawa.ca/en/living-ottawa/laws-licences-and-permits/laws/law-z/planning-development-and-construction/maps-and-zoning/zoning-law-no-2008-250/zoning-law-2008-250-consolidation/part-1-administration-interpretation-and-definitions-sections-1-54#section-29-46-interpreting-zoning-information)\n",
    "   * Nineteen zones where dwelling units are permitted have been selected (see the code cell below)\n",
    "   * A more rigorous approach would consider all of the exceptions granted in the subzones but those exceptions will be ignored here\n",
    "3. Generate a number of randomly distributed points within each dissemination area where the number of those points are based off of the 2016 census population. We don't have to based these numbers off the 2016 census data but it will help to produce a realisitc density\n",
    "4. Count the number of points that fall within each census tract, dissemination area, and neighborhood\n",
    "\n",
    "Generating a reasonably large population of synthetic points within these clipped dissemination areas can take quite a long time (about 15 mins for 93433 points on my old MacBook Pro). If you want to avoid the processing time just run the cell immediately below this one (\"Skip the point generation and just read them from a file\") and then jump ahead to the cell called \"Count the points in each census tract\". Or, if you want to make your own points then skip the next cell and run all of the others.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the statistical and visual representations of the synthetic results we can see a familiar pattern emerge. The error and correlation values show that when choosing between census tracts and dissemination areas the latter is the better choice. Also, when comparing between the two different approaches to interpolation, the dasymetric method is superior that the simple area weighted method. Bear in mind, the model in Part 2 is quite over-fit as we used the same land cover raster for the dasymetric interpolation and to create the bounds within which the synthetic points were generated - in reality there would quite a bit more variation. Despite this issue, I believe we can still conclude that using the finest spatial resolution of source data, whether through the choice geometries, or through the contribution of secondary information such as land cover, will give the best results when performing areal interpolation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where do we go from here? Well, other areal interpolation methods exits, for example Tobler offers functions for model-based and pycnophylactic interpolation, so future exercises could examine those methods and how they compare. It's likely that by using higher quality secondary data and taking more spatial considerations into account, the results can be improved even further.\n",
    "\n",
    "I hope that this tutorial was interesting and has helped to expand your familiarity with areal interpolation, Tobler, Pandas, GeoPandas, and Plotly.
